## 1. Project Overview

LibroTrack is a smart and efficient Library Management System designed to digitize and streamline the operations of a library. It enables administrators to manage books and members, track borrowing and returns, and automatically calculate fines. Members can browse the catalog, check book availability, and view their borrowing status. The system emphasizes a reliable and well-structured backend, developed entirely using Oracle Database and PL/SQL, and focuses on providing accurate, responsive, and secure operations.

## 2. Project Motivation

Manual record-keeping in traditional libraries is time-consuming, error-prone, and inefficient. Tasks like managing book stock, tracking due dates, or calculating fines are difficult without automation. LibroTrack aims to address these issues with a backend-heavy solution using Oracle, allowing us to apply theoretical DBMS concepts through advanced procedures, triggers, and queries.
